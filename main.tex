\section{Overview}
This is the first installment in a series of review exams to be taken after an exam to help solidify concepts and that can focus on problem areas in a simulated exam environment. This exam is broken up into three sections after which we will regroup and review what went wrong and what went right. 

\section{Section 1}
Evaluate each integral \\\\
1)$$\int_{\frac{-\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}sin(x)dx $$
\newpage
2)$$\int \frac{1}{5}e^{4t} dt $$
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
3)$$\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{3}} tan(x) dx $$
\newpage
\section{Section 2}
Evaluate using geometry \\
4)$$\int_{-3}^{3} \sqrt{9-x^2} dx $$
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
5) $$\int_{0}^{4}(x)dx + \int_{4}^{6}(4)dx + \int_{6}^{10}(-x)dx$$
\newpage
\section{Section 3}
A small puddle contains 50 $in^3$ of water when a 10 minute storm hits. As it rains, water accumulates in a puddle at a rate given by the function $r(t) = \frac{1}{2}x+2$. At the same time, water is evaporating from the puddle at a constant rate $e(t) = 6$.\\\\
a) How many inches of rain are added to the puddle during the 10-minute storm?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
b)Is the amount of water in the puddle increasing or decreasing at time t = 5 minutes?
\newpage
c) At what time during the storm is the amount of water in the puddle at a minimum?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
d) Find the total amount of water in the puddle at the end of the storm.
